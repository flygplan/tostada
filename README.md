# ToSTADA!

Tostada is Spanish for "toasted".

The tostada avoids waste when tortillas are not fresh enough to be made into tacos, but fresh enough to be eaten. The tortilla can be eaten fried or raw, even in dough form. The tortilla is fried in boiling oil until it becomes golden, rigid and crunchy, rather like a slice of toasted bread. 

Commercial tostadas —similar in taste and consistency to tortilla chips— are also widely available nowadays.
